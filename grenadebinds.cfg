// Keybinds for using grenades directly
// When you press the key it will switch to the grenade, once you throw it the game will switch back to your last weapon instantly.
// You can change the letter to change the key it is bound to

bind "h" "use weapon_hegrenade"   // High explosive grenade
bind "f" "use weapon_flashbang"   // Flashbang
bind "c" "use weapon_smokegrenade"   // Smoke grenade

// If you bind 'f' to flashbang like I did you may want to rebind the inspect weapon key
// Uncomment the following line if you want to change this key:
//bind "t" "+lookatweapon"

// If the binds don't work, uncomment the following line and put it at the end of your autoexec
//host_writeconfig
