# csgoconfigs
This is a repo for different csgo configs/software to make your experience better. Anything in a .cfg is source engine console code, so should be easy to add to your autoexec. I'll make some documentation for making your own autoexec soon.

Notice: Vibrance software is not actually made by me, and while it will almost certainly not result in a VAC ban (as it does not interact with the game at all) I cannot guarantee anything.
