# csgoconfigs
This is a repo for different csgo configs/software to make your experience better. Anything in a .cfg is source engine console code, so should be easy to add to your autoexec. I'll make some documentation for making your own autoexec soon.

## Vibrance Adjustment
Increasing your vibrance in csgo should increase the visibility of other players and objects in game. Also, in my experience it makes the game look much better. They work by changing the saturation in your graphics drivers.
They don't affect the game so you will most likely not get VAC banned. NVIDIA vibrance made by @juvlarN (the version I have built here has less features but works just as well)
ATI/AMD vibrance made by /u/kemicza on reddit.

I am planning to add Intel vibrance software soon.
