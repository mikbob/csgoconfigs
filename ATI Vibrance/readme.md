# ATI Vibrance adjuster

This program increases the vibrance of colours while CSGO is running. This makes enemies and objects easier to see as their colours stand out more.
**It only works for ATI/AMD graphics cards**

You can have it running permanently in the background. It is toggled on and off by pressing F11.

## Disclaimer

I did not code this software. You can see the original post here on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1o02it/ati_saturation_toggler/. 

Anyway, this tool **should** not VAC ban you. It does not interact with the game whatsoever, instead it uses the hotkey to turn the saturation up and down in the graphics card settings.

However, I take no responsibility in what may happen when you use this tool.
